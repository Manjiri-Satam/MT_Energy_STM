Ces enjeux font partie des priorit\\u00e9s du Rwanda. Ainsi, l'\\u00e9nergie est une des priorit\\u00e9s de la \\u00ab Vision 2020 \\u00bb, par laquelle le Rwanda cherche \\u00e0 devenir un pays \\u00e0 revenus moyens en 2020. Cette vision se traduit en divers plans strat\\u00e9giques dont le dernier est l'Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy II (EDPRS II 2012 -2017) qui explique que \\u00ab la croissance \\u00e9conomique, parmi d'autres choses, sera pouss\\u00e9e par la fourniture ininterrompue d'\\u00e9nergie \\u00e0 des prix qui seront stables et r\\u00e9gionalement comp\\u00e9titifs \\u00bb. L'acc\\u00e8s \\u00e0 des sources modernes d'\\u00e9nergie \\u00e0 des prix abordables sera crucial si le pays veut r\\u00e9aliser ses objectifs de d\\u00e9veloppement. Cette volont\\u00e9 se traduit dans le plan strat\\u00e9gique sectoriel 2013 -2018 (Annexe 8) o\\u00f9 le Rwanda vise un mix \\u00e9nerg\\u00e9tique au niveau de la production et une augmentation de l'acc\\u00e8s \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9nergie. En regard de l'EDPRS II, le plan strat\\u00e9gique pr\\u00e9voit 1) une augmentation des capacit\\u00e9s de production \\u00e9lectrique, notamment au travers des \\u00e9nergies renouvelables, 2) une augmentation de l'acc\\u00e8s \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9lectricit\\u00e9, 3) de garantir et de maintenir des tarifs comp\\u00e9titifs au niveau r\\u00e9gional. La Strat\\u00e9gie du Rwanda est donc de garantir la \\u00ab provision de fournitures \\u00e9nerg\\u00e9tiques en suffisance, fiables et abordables pour tous les Rwandais \\u00bb. La Belgique appuie la production et l'acc\\u00e8s \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9lectricit\\u00e9 depuis quelques ann\\u00e9es, au travers de ses interventions dans le \\u00ab secteur \\u00bb du d\\u00e9veloppement rural. Ainsi, elle a permis la construction par exemple de microcentrales hydro\\u00e9lectriques ou de lignes \\u00e9lectriques. En 2011, un Programme Indicatif de Coop\\u00e9ration a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 sign\\u00e9. L'un des secteurs de concentration est d\\u00e9sormais l'\\u00e9nergie, \\u00e0 hauteur de 55 millions d'euros. La pr\\u00e9sente intervention concerne plus sp\\u00e9cifiquement le renforcement des capacit\\u00e9s d'EWSA \\u2013 Energy, Water and Sanitation Agency, le renforcement des capacit\\u00e9s \\u00e9tant une priorit\\u00e9 transversale du PIC, et est abord\\u00e9e au travers d'un appui direct au Public Sector Capacity Building Secretariat (PSCBS, devenu NCBS) et au travers d'appuis sectoriels.Des interventions sont pr\\u00e9vues en parall\\u00e8les \\u00e0 la pr\\u00e9sente intervention dans le domaine de la production g\\u00e9othermique d'\\u00e9lectricit\\u00e9 (27 millions d'euros), et l'acc\\u00e8s \\u00e0 l'\\u00e9lectricit\\u00e9 (appui au programme national EARP Electricity Access Roll -out Program \\u2013 17 millions d'euros).Le renforcement des capacit\\u00e9s est essentiel pour le d\\u00e9veloppement du Rwanda en g\\u00e9n\\u00e9ral, et du secteur de l'\\u00e9nergie en particulier. Les r\\u00e9alisations attendues par le plan strat\\u00e9gique sectoriel 2013 -2018 ne seront r\\u00e9alisables que si, en plus des appuis \\u00e0 la production et \\u00e0 l'acc\\u00e8s, une attention est accord\\u00e9e au renforcement des capacit\\u00e9s et \\u00e0 la maintenance. Le d\\u00e9veloppement des capacit\\u00e9s est consid\\u00e9r\\u00e9 comme un \\u00e9l\\u00e9ment crucial de la strat\\u00e9gie EDPRS II. C'est ce que vise la pr\\u00e9sente intervention.

The project is organized around two PhD-projects at two linked scales that focus on i) ecosystem service bundles and their links to well-being and poverty, and ii) the role of cultural ecosystem services in contributing to well-being amongst the poor. We will combine qualitative and quantitative approaches, including GIS analyses, statistical modelling, surveys, PhotoVoice and focus group interviews. The project will build on an earlier u-Forsk project in the Eastern Cape of South Africa and include new sites in Mozambique.

This vision is reflected in various strategic plans, the last of which is the Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy II (EDPRS II 2012 -2017) which explains that \\\"economic growth, among other things, will be pushed by uninterrupted energy suppliesregionally competitive \\u201d.Access to modern energy sources at affordable prices will be crucial if the country wants to achieve its development objectives.This desire is reflected in the 2013-2018 sectoral strategic plan (Annex 8) where Rwanda targets an energy mix in terms of production and an increase in access to energy.With regard to the EDPRS II, the strategic plan provides 1) an increase in electricity production capacities, in particular through renewable energies, 2) an increase in access to electricity, 3) to guarantee and maintain competitive prices at the regional level.Rwanda's strategy is therefore to guarantee the \\\"provision of sufficient energy supplies, reliable and affordable for all Rwandans\\\".Belgium has supported production and access to electricity for a few years, through its interventions in the \\\"sector\\\" of rural development.Thus, it allowed the construction, for example, of hydroelectric microchentrals or electric lines.In 2011, an indicative cooperation program was signed.One of the concentration sectors is now energy, up to 55 million euros.This intervention concerns more specifically the capacity building of EWSA - Energy, Water and Sanitation Agency, capacity building being a transversal priority of the peak, and is discussed through direct support to the public Sector Capacity Building Secretariat (PSCBS, now NCBS) and through sectoral supports.Geothermal electricity production (27 million euros), and access to electricity (support for the National EARP Electricity Access Roll -Out Program -17 million euros). The capacity building is essential for the development of Rwanda in general, and the energy sector in particular.The achievements expected by the 2013-2018 sectoral strategic plan will only be achievable if, in addition to production and access support, attention is paid to capacity building and maintenance.The development of capacities is considered to be a crucial element of the EDPRS II strategy.This is what this intervention targets.In addition, we see that a lot of leases\",\n          \"Background:  The Junior Professional Officers (JPO) Programme, also known as the Associate Experts Programme, is a multilateral technical cooperation initiative sponsored by the Directorate General for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid of Belgium.
